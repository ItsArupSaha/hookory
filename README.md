## What is Hookory?

**Hookory** is an intelligent content repurposing engine designed for professionals, founders, and creators who want to build a personal brand on LinkedIn but don't have hours to spend writing from scratch.

Instead of staring at a blank page, Hookory allows you to take existing long-form content—like a blog post, news article, or a rough draft—and instantly transform it into a polished, high-engagement LinkedIn post tailored to your unique voice.

It’s not just a summarizer; it’s a strategic writing partner that understands the nuances of social media engagement, from hook writing to formatting for mobile readability.

## How It Works: The End-to-End Workflow

Creating high-quality content with Hookory is a simple, four-step process:

### 1. **Input Your Source**
You don't need to write new ideas to post new content.
*   **Paste a URL**: Have a great blog post or saw an interesting industry article? Just paste the link. Hookory reads the content directly.
*   **Paste Text**: Have some rough notes, a partial draft, or a transcript? Paste the raw text directly into the editor.

### 2. **Intelligent Analysis**
Once you submit your content, Hookory’s AI engine goes to work. It reads through the noise to identify the core value proposition, key insights, and actionable takeaways. It strips away fluff and focuses on what will actually resonate with a professional audience.

### 3. **Customize Your Strategy**
A generic post gets generic results. Hookory lets you tailor the output to fit your specific goals:
*   **Select Your Format**: Choose *how* you want to present the idea (e.g., a story, a lesson, or a carousel).
*   **Define Your Audience**: Who are you talking to? CEOs? Developers? General professionals?
*   **Set Your Goal**: Do you want more comments (Engagement), potential clients (Leads), or industry respect (Authority)?
*   **Tune the Tone**: Make it "Professional & Crisp" or "Conversational & Friendly."

### 4. **Generate & Publish**
In seconds, you get a fully formatted LinkedIn post ready for the feed.
*   **The Hook**: Every post starts with a scroll-stopping first line.
*   **The Body**: Clean, punchy sentences with mobile-optimized line breaks.
*   **The CTA**: A clear Call to Action to drive your specific goal.
*   **Hashtags**: Relevant, searchable tags included automatically.

Don't like the first result? Use the **Regenerate** feature to get a completely fresh angle in seconds.

## Intelligent features & Modes

Hookory offers specialized writing modes to match different content strategies:

### 🧠 Thought Leadership Mode
*Best for: Establishing authority and sharing opinions.*
This mode focuses on a single, strong insight or contrarian view. It uses a confident tone to challenge common beliefs or share deep expertise.
*   **Structure**: Strong Hook → Challenge/Insight → Evidence → Reflective Conclusion.

### 📖 Story-Based Mode
*Best for: Building connection and trust.*
Humans connect with stories, not just facts. This mode transforms dry experiences into a narrative arc, focusing on a specific struggle, a turning point, and a valuable lesson learned.
*   **Structure**: The Struggle → The Realization → The Transformation → The Takeaway.

### 🎠 Educational Carousel Mode
*Best for: Teaching complex topics.*
Perfect for breaking down "How-to" guides or listicles. This mode generates slide-by-slide text that you can copy directly into a PDF or image carousel design.
*   **Structure**: Slide 1 (Title) → Slides 2-5 (One tip per slide) → Final Slide (Summary).

### ⚡ Short Viral Hook Mode
*Best for: Maximum reach and readability.*
Minimalist and punchy. This mode strips away all explanations and focuses entirely on the impact. Great for quick tips or sharp observations that people want to repost.
*   **Structure**: 3-4 punchy lines → One clear truth.

## Smart Customization & History
