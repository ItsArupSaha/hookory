## What is Hookory?

**Hookory** is NOT a summarizer. It is a creator-grade repurposing engine designed for founders, professionals, and thought leaders who refuse to sound like ChatGPT.

Most AI tools use static templates (*"Here are 5 ways to..."*). Hookory uses a **Dynamic Extraction System (DES)** to pull unique angles, specific nouns, and bold opinions directly from your source material.

It doesn’t just "write" posts. It **ghostwrites** them with conviction, distinct voice archetypes, and zero robotic fluff.

## The Core Engines

Hookory operates on two distinct generation engines:

### 1. The Single Post Engine (Specific Impact)
Turn one source into one high-leverage post. Optimized for the "thumb-stop."

| Format | Best For | The DNA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📝 Main Post** | Thought Leadership | **Insight-First.** Opens with a contrarian claim or bold prediction derived from the source. No "Here's what I learned" fluff. |
| **📖 Story Post** | Building Trust | **Narrative-First.** Uses *Physical Anchor Extraction* to ground the story in a real scene (e.g., staring at a *Stripe Dashboard*, not a generic "laptop"). |
| **🎠 Carousel** | Teaching / Reach | **Open Loop Structure.** 5-7 slides where every slide ends with a micro-cliffhanger to force the swipe. |
| **⚡ Viral Hook** | Top of Funnel | **Punch-First.** Short, sharp, under 600 chars. Opens with a jarring stat or blunt truth to stop the scroll immediately. |

### 2. The Narrative Series Engine (4-Day Calendar)
Turn one rich source (long blog, video transcript, whitepaper) into a **cohesive 4-day content campaign**.

Instead of writing 4 random posts, the Series Engine slices user content into a linear narrative arc:

*   **DAY 1: The Context (The Setup)**
    *   *Goal:* Define the status quo and interrupt it.
    *   *Type:* Main Post or Viral Hook.
*   **DAY 2: The Mistake (The Tension)**
    *   *Goal:* Call out what most people get wrong. Challenge conventional wisdom.
    *   *Type:* Contrarian / Problem-Focused.
*   **DAY 3: The Framework (The Solution)**
    *   *Goal:* Teach the specific "How-To" or system from the source.
    *   *Type:* Educational / Step-by-Step.
*   **DAY 4: The Outcome (The Proof)**
    *   *Goal:* Show the tangible results/impact. Validate the approach.
    *   *Type:* Story or Data-Backed Case Study.

> **The Calendar Test:** The engine ensures that if you posted these Mon-Thu, your audience would feel like they are getting fresh, progressing insights every day, not repetitive noise.

## What Makes It Different? (The "Anti-Template" Logic)

Hookory enforces strict quality rules at the code level to prevent "AI slop."

### ✅ Dynamic Prop Extraction (No Generic Anchors)
*   If you write a story about coding, Hookory extracts *specifics*: "Terminal window," "Pull Request," "Bug Report."
*   **BANNED:** Generic terms like "laptop," "coffee," "meeting room," "screen."

### ✅ Conviction Injection
Every generated post must contain at least one of these friction points:
*   A **Contrarian Claim** (*"Everyone optimizes for X, but Y is the real metric."*)
*   A **Bold Prediction** (*"In 2 years, this strategy will be dead."*)
*   An **Uncomfortable Truth** (*"Most founders lie about this."*)
*   *If a reasonable person can't disagree with the post, Hookory considers it failed.*

### ✅ Stat Integrity (Zero Hallucination)
*   If the source has numbers, Hookory uses them.
*   If the source has NO numbers, Hookory is **forbidden** from inventing them. It uses qualitative anchors instead (*"I've seen this fail..."*).

### ✅ Engagement-First CTAs
No more *"What do you think?"* or *"Agree?"*. Hookory generates CTAs designed to spark debate:
*   **The Hot Take:** *"Change my mind: X is overrated."*
*   **The Confession:** *"What's the expensive mistake you made doing this?"*
*   **The Challenge:** *"Prove me wrong."*
